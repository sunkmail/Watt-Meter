# Watt-Meter
AC Watt meter using mostly salvaged components

This project is to make a AC power meter for determining total load of a device in any/all modes - functional, standby, parasitic.

ie:

My computer monitor requires how much power when: 
      ON and I'm using the computer?
      ON, in "screensaver" mode
      ON, in Standby/power down mode  (Blank screen)
      OFF, but still plugged into the wall (mains) power

This is not a 'New' design, but rather a mash-up of other open source ideas from around the Web.   


The Schematic and PCB designs are available at: https://easyeda.com/sunkmail/Watt_Meter-AGDnJH3NL

The majority of my parts have been salvaged from commercial and consumer electronics, therefore I don't have full part numbers, suppliers, or prices.


Initially, the project will be made on a breadboard using an Arduino Pro-Mini.  I plan on advancing the firmware, over time, to work on a 8266 chip (esp-12 Module) allowing connection as an IOT type device with datalogging, graphs, etc.   

This is not going to be happening fast. IOT is VERY new to me, and I've been out of the Electronics game for 15 years - a lot has changed!

This project's theory and most of the programming will be done physically away from my equipment, so I expect a lot of changes as testing starts up.


Feel free to ask questions - I'll do my best to answer.  Plus, it'll keep me motivated.
